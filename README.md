# DIGI-GUARDIAN-MALWARE-DETECTION

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Mobile devices have become vital to everyone’s lifestyle. It is hard to imagine one’s day without them. However, because we rely on mobile phones so heavily, certain malware attacks have been rapidly growing. A user tends to download an application from the app store for various reasons. Most of the time we neglect to check the permission settings that are granted for an application in default and proceed ahead without thinking twice. Certain default permissions turn into a path that leads to malware attacks on our devices. Malicious software gets downloaded and thereby causes significant risks. This malware, once present, poses significant threats to personal data and security. As hackers continue to exploit various vulnerabilities in IoT systems, the seamless integration of IoT technology into our lives is at risk. 
## GOAL: 
To tackle these increasingly complex challenges, there is a pressing demand for the development of a resilient system designed to proficiently detect and classify malware across a spectrum of devices, encompassing both mobile and IoT systems. To address these converging challenges, the need arises for a robust system capable of detecting malware on mobile devices, ensuring a secure digital environment for all. The model being developed must be able to classify whether the data is Malware i.e., our class of interest, or safe i.e., Benign based on the permissions as requested.
## DATASET SOURCE: 
We have chosen our dataset from the UCI repository as follows:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/722/naticusdroid+android+permissions+dataset

## DATASET DESCRIPTION: 
Here we are considering a dataset that includes features that help classify whether the application is Benign or Malignant. 

The chosen dataset has 86 distinct features and 29333 instances, which can be used to train and test our model. Each column represents a specific permission granted to that application. <br>
The features include the following: <br>
• Read Access: Access to read the data present  <br>
• Write Access: Access to edit the data such as user preferences <br>
• Location Access: Whether the location of the user must be available to the application <br>
• External Storage Access: Access to External Storage <br>
• Cache Memory Access: Access to cache memory <br>
• Receive SMS: Access to message alerts <br>
• Manage Accounts: Whether multiple accounts data needs to be saved <br>
• Install Shortcuts: Access to create shortcuts on the homepage of the device <br>
• Bluetooth Access: Whether Bluetooth needs to be enabled always or not <br>
• Camera Access: Whether camera access must be provided to that application <br>
• Billing Access: Whether credit card or debit card details need to be saved <br>
• Authentication Access: Access to verify the user’s identity <br>

The dataset is comprised of binary values either 0 or 1. A binary value 0 indicates that permission has not been requested while value 1 indicates that permission is required for that application.  <br>
The Result column denotes the presence or absence of malware. In the future, we can anticipate whether the application is malicious or not based on the permissions requested. <br>

## PROJECT PLAN:
##### Data Pre-Processing:  <br>
1.	Handling the missing data by removing them or imputing them with some techniques like mean, median etc.
2.	Standardizing the numerical variables.
##### Exploratory Data Analysis:  <br>
1.	Exploring the data to understand anomalies like outlier etc.
2.	Understanding the relation between the features and the target variable. <br>
##### Feature Selection:  <br>
1.	Selecting the important features from the insights we get from EDA and domain knowledge
2.	Applying some statistical techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance score to remove the correlated feature and get the important features. <br>
##### Model Training:  <br>
1.	Splitting the data into training, testing and validation sets and fit the logistic regression model(we will also explore other models like KNN, Decision Trees) to the training data.
2.	Tuning the hyper parameters using techniques like grid search etc to fit the best possible model. <br>
##### Model Interpretation & Evaluation:  <br>
1.	Model coefficients are used to interpret the impact on the target variable from each feature.
2.	The performance of the model is evaluated against validation data on various performance factors like Precision, Sensitivity, Accuracy, Specificity, and F1-Score. 
3.	At last, use the model to generate predictions on the unseen data i.e. test data and evaluate its performance.
