# DIGI-GUARDIAN-MALWARE-DETECTION
"Digi Guardian: Malware Detection" implements malware detection using custom-built models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks, without inbuilt libraries. The project covers data pre-processing, visualization, feature selection, and evaluates models based on precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-Score.
